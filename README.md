# Trade Penguin - Stock Application

Summary: <br>
Trade Penguin is a full-fledged CRUD application. It allows the user to register and sign in to a stock trading platform where they can buy, sell and manage stocks using fantasy money. It was written in HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python. It uses React, Bootstrap, Flask as an internal API, CLOUD IEX as an external API to pull accurate stock information and PostgreSQL, as well as Flask SQL Alchemy for database management.

What I learned: <br>
This project allowed me to take a deeper dive into full stack development. It's one of the largest projects I've done to date, so separating concerns was important to keep organized. Previous projects had introduced me to aspects of CRUD which were all brought together to build this application. I previously had minimal knowledge of the stock market, so I was challenged to learn generally about stocks as I worked with the Cloud IEX API. I additionally challenged myself by implementing Flask SQL Alchemy to manage my database and React Google Charts to display all of the data. There was no shortage of bugs throughout, which gave me the opportunity to build on my problem-solving skills. Finding solutions helped to refine my understanding of the entire full stack process.
